flixel CHANGELOG

v1.08
------------------------------
* New draw stack rendering system for cpp and neko targets (replacement for layer system). It is simpler to use but little bit slower.
* NME 3.5.1 compatible
* Bug fixes for FlxText (shadow problem) and tweening (for oneshot tween)
* FlxTextField class now works on flash target also and can be used as input field, but I've removed multicamera support
* Small optimizations from @crazysam
* Added FlxBackdrop addon class
* Added TaskManager addon (ported from AntHill: https://github.com/AntKarlov/Anthill-Framework)
* Added onFocusLost() and onFocus() methods to FlxState class. These methods will called when app losts and gets focus. Override them in subclasses.

v1.07
------------------------------
* New layer system for cpp and neko targets. See https://github.com/Beeblerox/HaxeFlixel/wiki/Introduction-in-layer-system-%5BEN%5D
* Fixed draw position round issue for cpp and neko targets. It uses less math methods and more accurate now.
* Added drawTiles() counter in debugger output (on cpp and neko targets).
* Added BACKWARD and PINGPONG tween types. Thanks @devolonter!
* Added cancel() method to FlxTween
* Added initial support for html5 target. But it's very-very slow
* Added NestedSprite addon. It is some sort of display object container, a very limited one, but powerfull enough (it's not in finished state right now but usable).
* Added FlxTrail class (thanks @crazysam)
* Fixed ZoomCamera addon class
* Change FlxEmitter behavior, so it can kill itself when all particles are dead
* Fixed FlxCollision plugin, so all of it's method are working on flash, cpp and neko targets
* Added FlxGamePad and FlxAnalog controls (initial state). Thanks to WingEraser for his Flixel-Android port (I took them from there).
* Lots of small fixes, changes and tweaks (thanks to Samuel Batista aka crazysam and @FlixelCommunity)

v1.06
------------------------------
* Added FlxKongregate plugin (flash only). Thanks to goldengrave for porting this class.
* Fixed bug with FlxButton's makeGraphic() crashing on cpp and neko targets.
* Fixed bug with VarTween and MultivarTween on Haxe 2.10
* Fixed bug when FlxGroup's tweens weren't updated
* Added new logo. Huge thanks to Impaler!!!
* Added StarfieldFX class from FlixelPowerTools.

v1.05
------------------------------
* Fixed bug with animation callback for FlxSprite on cpp target
* Ported FlxButtonPlus class from FlixelPowerTools
* Fixed Android sound issue. Thanks to Adrian K. (@goshki) for testing
* Added FlxSkewedSprite class (see skewedSprite example on github repo). This class isn't optimized for flash target
* Added loadFrom() method for FlxSprite. So you can easily copy graphics from one FlxSprite to another. This is especially usefull for cpp target. Thanks to Phoenity for this idea
* Initial support for Haxe 2.10
* Added basic support for multitouch (see FlxG.touchManager and multitouch example on github repo). Flash version requires Flash Player 10.1 now.
* Compile fix for FlxPreloader on mac platform. Thanks to Talii for it.
* Integrated tweening system from HaxePunk (Thank you, Matt Tuttle). All FlxBasic's subclasses have this functionality now. See addTween(), removeTween(), clearTweens() methods of FlxBasic instances and 'org.flixel.tweens' package.
* Added basic support for Joystick input (See FlxG.joystickManager and org.flixel.system.input.Joystick and org.flixel.system.input.JoystickManager classes for details). I need someone to test it.

v1.04
------------------------------
* Fixed bug with FlxCamera's color property on cpp target. Sorry for it

v1.03
------------------------------
* Updated rendering system for cpp target so it uses 2d tile transformations now (which means non-uniform scaling is working now)
* FlxBitmapTextField's background property is working on cpp target now
* Replaced FlxDictionary with ObjectHash (for FlxControlHandler plugin)
* Added BTNTileMap class (which can be found in org.flixel.addons package) from http://bullettimeninja.blogspot.com/2012/01/lasers-and-ray-casting.html
* Added ZoomCamera class (also in org.flixel.addons package) from http://bullettimeninja.blogspot.com/2011/09/zoom-camera.html
* Made a little optimization for FlxSprite's onScreen() method for cpp target (not using Math.sqrt() now)
* Added width and height getters/setters for FlxCamera on flash target
* Made small optimizations in rendering for cpp target (the way it pushes and splices draw data)
* Fixed pixelPerfectPointCheck() method from FlxCollision plugin
* Made pixelPerfectCheck() method from FlxCollision plugin work on flash only. It's always returns false on other targets. Sorry:(
* Fixed FlxCamera's bug with changing it's size (width, height and zoom)

v1.02
------------------------------
* Ported FlxBar class
* Added FlxBitmapTextField class (background property isn't working on cpp for now)
* Added PxButton class which uses FlxBitmapTextField for text rendering
* Replaced Dynamic with appropriate types (where it was possible)
* Improvements in FlxQuadTree and FlxObject (less garbage)
* Changed TileSheet creation process to insert gaps between frames. This should solve 'pixel bleeding' problem

v1.01

* Fixed issue with FlxTextField class when it wasn't affected by fade() and flash() effects (on cpp and neko targets)
* Improvements in memory consumption for FlxTileBlock and FlxBitmapFont classes
