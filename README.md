______________________________________________________

###Getting Started

You can read our getting started docs [here](http://haxeflixel.com/wiki/getting-started).

It is recomended to use Haxeflixel via [Haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/p/flixel). Just run `haxelib install flixel` once you have it installed.

###Changes for HaxeFlixel 3.0

This is the third big update to HaxeFlixel. Here are the biggest changes:
- New [Front End](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/tree/master/flixel/system/frontEnds) classes to better encapsulate FlxG functionality.
- Refactored the [animation system](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/tree/master/flixel/animation).
- Better support for nested sprites via [FlxSpriteGroup](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/blob/master/flixel/group/FlxSpriteGroup.hx). FlxSpriteGroups can be contained within other groups, and behave like FlxSprites. They are expensive though, use them sparringly.
- Moved lots of stuff into [utility classes](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/tree/master/flixel/util) to reduce clutter in core classes.
- Continued optimizations for cpp targets.

###Upgrading from previous versions

// TODO

###For Developers

Make sure you're using latest version of [Haxe, HaxeLib and OpenFl](http://haxeflixel.com/comment/2584#comment-2584). Also bookmark the [haxelib guide](http://haxe.org/doc/haxelib/using_haxelib).

Clone this repository by running `haxelib git flixel https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel dev`.

We recommended that you use a GUI application to manage your changes ([SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)).

HaxeFlixel was created by Alexander Hohlov, also known as [Beeblerox](https://github.com/beeblerox) who continues to be the project lead. The codebase started largely from a Haxe port of the [AS3 version of Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) written by [Adam “Atomic” Saltsman](http://www.adamatomic.com/) and [Richard Davey's](http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools) [Power Tools](https://github.com/photonstorm/Flixel-Power-Tools)

- Flexible Asset Management System
- Cross-platform development for Linux, Mac and Windows
- Texture Atlas and Layer enhancement for cpp targets
- Integrated and robust Tween System
- Access to OpenFL native extensions
- Compile to Mobile and Desktop targets with native code through OpenFL
- Impressive Native Performance using GPU accelerated drawTiles implimentation in cpp targets
- A powerful debugger with a console as well as an advanced logging system
- A vibrant community that keeps updating the engine and adding new features to it
