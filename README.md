## About

HaxeFlixel was created by Alexander Hohlov, also known as [Beeblerox](https://github.com/beeblerox) who continues to be the project lead. The codebase started largely from a Haxe port of the [AS3 version of Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) written by [Adam “Atomic” Saltsman](http://www.adamatomic.com/) and [Richard Davey's](http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools) [Power Tools](https://github.com/photonstorm/Flixel-Power-Tools)

Special thanks go to the community contributors [Werdn](https://github.com/werdn), [gamedevsam](https://github.com/gamedevsam), [impaler](https://github.com/impaler), [ProG4mr](https://github.com/ProG4mr), [Gama11](https://github.com/Gama11), [sergey-miryanov](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov) and more.

HaxeFlixel presents substantial enhancements from the original Flixel AS3 code:

- Use of a robust and powerful, open source language
- Flexible Asset Management System
- Cross-platform development for Linux, Mac and Windows
- Texture Atlas and Layer enhancement for cpp targets
- Integrated and robust Tween System
- Access to OpenFL native extensions
- Compile to Mobile and Desktop targets with native code through OpenFL
- Impressive Native Performance using GPU accelerated drawTiles implementation on cpp targets
- A powerful debugger with a console as well as an advanced logging system
- A vibrant community that keeps updating the engine and adding new features to it
