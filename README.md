About
=
______________________________________________________
HaxeFlixel is an open source 2d game library written in the [Haxe Language](http://www.haxe.org/) that is completely free for personal or commercial use.
This library features integration with the [Haxe NME](http://www.haxenme.org/) framework to make multiple targets possible such as Android and IOS. 
Haxe also presents various other benefits such as having a more flexible opensource language.

HaxeFlixel is based on the As3 version of Flixel written by [Adam “Atomic” Saltsman](http://www.adamatomic.com/) , [Flixel Github](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel).
