Haxe port of Flixel v2.55
It targets flash, cpp and neko targets currently.
For flash it uses standart bitmap renderer and for cpp and neko targets - hardware accelerated drawTiles renderer.

For differencies between these two render systems see https://github.com/Beeblerox/HaxeFlixel/wiki/Differences-between-Flash-and-CPP-render-systems
Plus it contains ports of some FlixelPowerTools' classes (such as FlxExtendedSprite, FlxWeapon, FlxControl etc.). Full list of ported additinal classes from Flixel's community can be seen here: https://github.com/Beeblerox/HaxeFlixel/wiki/Additional-classes-from-the-flixel-community

As a example, this branch contains port of Adam 'Atomic' Saltsman Mode Demo also.
