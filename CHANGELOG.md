4.0.0
------------------------------
* Added `FlxStrip` class which allows to draw triangles (just like `drawTriangles()` on flash). It's extremely slow in blit render mode, but works reasonably fast in tile render mode.
* Made the blit and tile renderers more general. They still work quite differently, but share a lot of code.
* Reworked tile renderer, it doesn't use `addTileRect()` anymore (but uses `Tilesheet.TILE_RECT` flag now), so flixel won't work with old versions of OpenFL
* Added experimental rendering which works with `drawTriangles()` method. You can enable it if you set `FLX_RENDER_TRIANGLE` haxedef in project.xml (depends on `FlxG.renderTile` to be true).
* `FlxFrame`:
 * doesn't store the frame's bitmapatas anymore, so `getBitmap()` and other bitmap methods have been removed
 * added `paint()` and `paintFlipped()` methods instead. This solution requires much less memory, but will be a bit slower.

 * `setBounds()` -> `setScrollBoundsRect()` (#1070)
 * added `setScrollBounds()`
 * added `targetOffset` (#1056)
 * added `scrollRect` sprite which crops camera's view when the camera is scaled
 * camera is scaled from its center, not from the top left corner
 * `followLerp` is now a range taking values from 0 to (`60 / FlxG.updateFramerate`) - the closer to zero the more lerp! (#1220)
 * added `snapToTarget()` (#1477)
 * `fade()`: fixed `FadeIn == true` not working in a fade out callback (#1666)
* `FlxMath`:
 * `bound()` and `inBounds()` now accept `null` as values, meaning "unbounded in that direction" (#1070)

 * added `reversed` var which allows you to play animation backwards
 * second argument of `play()` method is `Reversed` now
 * added `flipX` and `flipY` (#1670)
* `FlxSpriteUtil`:
 * `drawLine()`: default settings for `lineStyle` are now thickness 1 and color white
 * `fadeIn()` and `fadeOut()` now tween `alpha` instead of `color`
 * added `drawCurve()` (#1263)
 * removed `FillStyle`, the same functionality is now covered by `FillColor`
 * moved `screenCenter()` to `FlxObject` and changed the the arguments from two booleans to the `FlxAxes` enum (#1541)
* `FlxEmitter`:
 * `at()` -> `focusOn()`
 * `on` -> `emitting`
 * emitters and particles now use `FlxColor` instead of separate red, green, and blue values
 * removed `FlxEmitterExt`, `FlxEmitter` now has two launch modes: `CIRCLE` (the new default) and `SQUARE` (#1174)

 * `maxLifespan` -> `lifespan`, `lifespan` -> `age`, percent indicates `(age / lifespan)`
 * `age` counts up (as opposed to `lifespan`, which counted down)
 * range properties (`velocityRange`, `alphaRange`) which determine particle behavior after launch
 * "active" flags (`alphaRange.active`, `velocityRange.active`, etc) which `FlxEmitter` uses to control particle behavior
* Moved `FlxMath`, `FlxPoint`, `FlxVector`, `FlxRect`, `FlxAngle`, `FlxVelocity` and `FlxRandom` to `flixel.math`
* `FlxPath`: exposed `nodeIndex` as a read-only property
* `FlxAssets`: `cacheSounds()` -> `FlxG.sound.cacheAll()` (#1097)

 	* each gamepad now has a `model`
 	* moved the ID classes to `flixel.input.gamepad.id`
 	* all IDs are now mapped to a value in `FlxGamepadInputID`
 	* the previous "raw" gamepad IDs are now available via separate functions

 * added `loadRotatedFrame()` method which allows you to generate prerotated image from given frame and load it
 * added error message then trying to get pixels and graphic is null
 * made `drawFrame()` method not inlined, so it can be redefined in subclasses. For example, you can use it in `FlxText` now if you need to force immediate graphic regeneration.
 * always change sprite's prerotated animation angle in sprite's `angle` setter, so there won't be any "lag" with it
 * removed `resetFrameBitmaps()` method, since frames don't store bitmaps anymore. Just set `dirty` to true to force sprite's frame graphic regeneration on next render loop.
 * added `useFramePixels`
* Added some helpful error messages when trying to target older SWF versions
* `FlxAngle`:
 * changed `rotatePoint()` to not invert the y-axis anymore and rotate clockwise (consistent with `FlxSprite#angle`)

  * `looped` is exposed as a public variable
  * added `pitch` (#1465)
* `FlxVelocity`: `accelerateTowards()`-functions now only take a single `maxSpeed` argument (instead of x and y)
* `FlxG.signals`:
  * split `gameReset` into pre/post signals
  * added `preStateCreate` (#1557)
* `BaseScaleMode`: added `hAlign` and `vAlign` properties, so you can switch game's align mode on both axis
* `RatioScaleMode#new()`: added a `fillScreen` option

* `FlxGraphic`: added `defaultPersist` (#1241)
* `FlxPool`: improved pooling performance (#1189)

* `FlxState`:
 * `onFocus()` and `onFocusLost()` no longer require `FlxG.autoPause` to be false
 * added `switchTo()` (#1676)
* Moved `FlxAtlas` and `FlxNode` in `flixel.graphics.atlas` package
* Added `addNodeWithSpacings()` in `FlxAtlas`
* Added `getTileFrames()` and `getImageFrame` in `FlxNode` which generate frames collections for this node
* Rewrote big part of `FlxAtlas`:
 * added `minWidth`, `minHeight` properties which sets minimum size of atlas canvas
 * added `maxWidth`, `maxHeight` properties which sets maximum size of atlas canvas
 * so the atlas can be expanded while new images are added in the atlas. It starts from minimum size and grows up to maximum size (if there is no free space to hold new images)
 * added `powerOfTwo` property, which forces atlas size to be the power of two number (if true)
 * added `allowRotation` property, which is settable only in atlas constructor and tells whether new image added in the atlas could be rotated to fit in existing empty atlas nodes

* Added static methods to `FlxGraphic` class for generation of objects of this type from various sources: `fromAssetKey()`, `fromClass()`, `fromBitmapData()`
* `FlxGraphic`'s `bitmap` property is now settable, changing it will lead to regeneration of graphic's tilesheet. `FlxAtlas` uses this feature, since it could increase its size and therefore change its bitmapdata canvas
* Added new conception of frames collections instead of regions, which required a lot of typing to get simple spritesheet from image region
* Added `FlxImageFrame` frames collection which contains single frame
* Added `FlxTileFrames` frames collection which contains frames for spritesheet, which can be generated from image region or frame (including rotated and trimmed frames)
* Added `FlxAtlasFrames` frames collection instead of various texture atlas loaders (like `SparrowData` and `TexturePackerData`). It contains various static methods for parsing atlas files
* Rewrote `PxBitmapFont` class and renamed it to `FlxBitmapFont`. It supports (can parse) AngelCode, XNA and Monospace bitmap fonts now
* Rewrote `FlxBitmapTextField` class and renamed it to `FlxBitmapText`
* `FlxBitmapText`: removed `size` property
* Added `FlxFilterFrames` frames collection instead of `FlxSpriteFilter` (see filters demo)
* Changed `FlxGraphicAsset` from `OneOfFive<String, Class<Dynamic>, CachedGraphics, TextureRegion, BitmapData>` to `OneOfThree<FlxGraphic, BitmapData, String>` which means that graphic loading methods (in all classes) accept only these three types of objects
* `FlxBitmapDataUtil`:
 * added `replaceColor()` which is used by `FlxSprite`'s `replaceColor()` method
 * added `addSpacing()` which takes BitmapData and generates new one with spaces between frames
 * added `generateRotations()` which generates new BitmapData with prerotated given BitmapData object (this functionality is moved from `FlxSprite`)
* `FlxAnalog` and `FlxVirtualPad` now have their own atlas with default graphic, so they propduce less draw calls
* Added `FlxSpriteButton` which is button which label is a simple `FlxSprite`. It has a useful `createTextLabel()` method which generates a sprite with text graphic.
* `FlxSignal`: fixed a bug that occured when calling `remove()` during a dispatch (#1420)
* `FlxG.debugger`: fixed a crash when calling `addTrackerProfile()` before `track()`
* Added `filtersEnabled` and `setFilters()` to `FlxCamera` and `FlxGame` (#1635)

3.3.1
------------------------------
* FlxKeyboard: fixed function keys being offset by 1 on cpp (F2-F13)
* FlxTilemap: fixed possible crash during collision checks
* FlxG.sound.play(): fixed volume parameter not working

3.3.0
------------------------------
* Added flash gamepad support. This either requires a swf-player-version of 11.8 to be set or FLX_NO_GAMEPAD to be defined.
 * FlxGamepad.getAxis() has been split into getXAxis() and getYAxis() for consistency across targets
 * FlxGamepad.dpadUp / Down / Left / Right don't work in flash, use getButton() in conjunction with the IDs in the button ID classes instead
* Added "tracker" window to the debugger which creates a Watch window with the most important properties of an object
 * Use FlxG.debugger.track(Object); to create a new tracker window
 * Use FlxG.debugger.addTrackerProfile() to add a profile for classes don't have one yet or override existing ones
 * Use the "track [object]" command to open a tracker window from the console
* FlxCamera: 
 * Added static defaultCameras array which is used by FlxBasics when their cameras array has not been set - previously the use of FlxG.cameras.list / all existing cameras was hardcoded
 * Fixed a bug where following a target would prevent you from setting the coordinates of the camera
* Added pooling for FlxPoint, FlxVector, and FlxRect. Usage: var point = FlxPoint.get(); /* do stuff with point */ point.put(); // recycle point. FlxPoint.weak() should be used instead of get() when passing points into flixel functions, that way they'll be recycled automatically.
* Debugger windows:
 * Fixed dragging of overlapping windows
 * Fixed the visibility of windows on native targets (now saving correctly)
 * Fixed resizing when moving the mouse to the left / above the window
* FlxPath: fixed a bug with drawDebug()
* FlxG:
 * fullscreen: fixed offset in flash
 * openURL(): now adds "http://" to the URL if necessary
 * Added maxElapsed
 * Fixed some variables not being reset in resetGame()
 * added FlxG.accelerometer for mobile targets
* FlxSound: 
 * Added loadByteArray()
 * Now has a read-only variable time
 * Allow sound caching on all targets instead of only on Android
 * Added FlxG.sound.soundTrayEnabled to allow dis- and enabling the tray at runtime
 * survive -> persist
* MouseEventManager: 
 * Improved handling of visible / exists
 * Now works on FlxObjects
 * addSprite() -> add()
* FlxPoint: 
 * Added floor() and ceil()
 * Added add() and addPoint() (removed add() from FlxVector)
 * Added subtract() and subtractPoint() (removed substract() from FlxVector)
* Changed the default html5 backend to openfl-bitfive
 * Middle and right mouse events are now supported
 * Sounds are now supported
* FlxObject: replaced forceComplexRender by pixelPerfectRender which rounds coordinates by default (if true) for drawing (also on cpp targets, making it consistent with flash)
* FlxText: 
 * Added shadowOffset
 * Fixed the widthInc and heightInc of addFilter() which did not work at all previously
 * Seperated visible and physical width by adding fieldWidth to fix a bug
 * Added autoSize that makes sure the entire text is displayed if true with wordWrap = false. Setting fieldWidth to 0 in the constructor is now allowed and activates this behaviour.
 * Fixed variation in height of empty texts
* FlxSpriteUtil: added bound()
* FlxSpriteGroup:
 * Added FlxTypedSpriteGroup, which can be used in the same way as FlxTypedGroup, but its type parameter is T:FlxSprite
 * Setting cameras will now set cameras on its members, add()-ing a sprite will synchronize the values
* Abstracted rendering into FLX_RENDER_TILE and FLX_RENDER_BLIT conditionals as opposed to being hardcoded based on the target
* FlxTween:
 * num(): added an optional tweenFunction parameter which can be used for increased performance (as MultiVarTween and SingleVarTween are fairly slow, using Reflection)
 * singleVar() and multiVar() have been replaced by tween()
 * Removed SfxFader and Fader
* FlxKeyboard:
 * Implemented a workaround for function and numpad keys not working on native targets
