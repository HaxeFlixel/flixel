3.3.0
------------------------------
* Added flash gamepad support. This either requires a swf-player-version of 11.8 to be set or FLX_NO_GAMEPAD to be defined.
 * FlxGamepad.getAxis() has been split into getXAxis() and getYAxis() for consistency across targets
 * FlxGamepad.dpadUp / Down / Left / Right don't work in flash, use getButton() in conjunction with the IDs in the button ID classes instead
* Added "tracker" window to the debugger which creates a Watch window with the most important properties of an object
 * Use FlxG.debugger.track(Object); to create a new tracker window
 * Use FlxG.debugger.addTrackerProfile() to add a profile for classes don't have one yet or override existing ones
 * Use the "track [object]" command to open a tracker window from the console
* FlxCamera: 
 * Added static defaultCameras array which is used by FlxBasics when their cameras array has not been set - previously the use of FlxG.cameras.list / all existing cameras was hardcoded
 * Fixed a bug where following a target would prevent you from setting the coordinates of the camera
* Added pooling for FlxPoint, FlxVector, and FlxRect (FlxPath and FlxTimer also support pooling, but that is handled transparently). Usage: var point = FlxPoint.get(); /* do stuff with point */ point.put(); // recycle point. Instantiating these objects directly via new() is no longer possible to enforce the use of pooling. FlxPoint.weak() should be used instead of get() when passing points into flixel functions, that way they'll be recycled automatically.
* Debugger windows:
 * Fixed dragging of overlapping windows
 * Fixed the visibility of windows on native targets (now saving correctly)
 * Fixed resizing when moving the mouse to the left / above the window
* FlxPath: fixed a bug with drawDebug()
* FlxG:
 * fullscreen: fixed offset in flash
 * openURL(): now adds "http://" to the URL if necessary
 * Added FlxG.maxElapsed
* FlxSound: 
 * Added loadByteArray()
 * Now has a read-only variable time
 * Allow sound caching on all targets instead of only on Android
 * Added FlxG.sound.soundTrayEnabled to allow dis- and enabling the tray at runtime

* FlxPoint: added floor() and ceil()
* Changed the default html5 backend to openf-bitfive
 * Middle and right mouse events are now supported
 * Sounds are now supported
* FlxObject: replaced forceComplexRender by pixelPerfectRender which rounds coordinates by default (if true) for drawing (also on cpp targets, making it consistent with flash)
* FlxText: 
 * Added shadowOffset
 * Fixed the widthInc and heightInc of addFilter() which did not work at all previously
 * Seperated visible and physical width by adding fieldWidth to fix a bug
 * Added autoSize that makes sure the entire text is displayed if true with wordWrap = false. Setting fieldWidth to 0 in the constructor is now allowed and activates this behaviour.
* FlxSpriteUtil: added bound()
* FlxSpriteGroup:
 * Added FlxTypedSpriteGroup, which can be used in the same way as FlxTypedGroup, but its type parameter is T:FlxSprite
 * Setting cameras will now set cameras on its members, add()-ing a sprite will synchronize the values
* Abstracted rendering into FLX_RENDER_TILE and FLX_RENDER_BLIT conditionals as opposed to being hardcoded based on the target
* FlxTween:
 * num(): added an optional tweenFunction parameter which can be used for increased performance (as MultiVarTween and SingleVarTween are fairly slow, using Reflection)
 * Tweens are now being pooled
 * Added sfx()
 * singleVar() and multiVar() have been replaced by tween()
* FlxKeyboard:
 * Implemented a workaround for function and numpad keys not working on native targets
 * Added FlxKey.NUMPADMULTIPLY / "NUMPADMULTIPLY" 
* Added FlxCallbackPoint, a FlxPoint that calls a function when x, y or both are changed.
* FlxTilemap: 
 * Replaced scaleX and scaleY by a scale FlxPoint
 * Removed rayHit(), ray() provides the same functionality
* Added FlxDestroyUtil (FlxG.safeDestroy() -> FlxDestroyUtil.destroy())
* Debugger stats window: added a button to expand the window and show two more graphs (draw and update time)
* Added buildFileReferences() macro to FlxAssets.hx (auto-completion for asset string paths)
* FlxTilemap.computePathDistance() is now public and has a new StopOnEnd parameter
* Added FlxColor.MAGENTA
* Added FlxMouse.setGlobalScreenPositionUnsafe()
* FlxTypedButton: 
 * Fixed label.visible = false; not working
 * Fixed a one-frame-delay between setting the label's position and it taking effect
 * Fixed label scrollfactor being out of sync before the first update()
* FlxButton: Added a text property as a shortcut for label.text
* FlxSprite:
 * Added support for more texture packer formats: LibGDXData, SparrowData, TexturePackerXMLData
 * Fixed a null error crash in FlxAtlas on cpp targets with haxe 3.1.0+
 * Added flipHorizontally() and flipVertically(), using negative scale
 * setOriginToCenter() -> centerOrigin()
* FlxPreloader:
 * Small fix that should prevent it from getting stuck 
 * Added siteLockURLIndex to control which URL in allowdURLs is used when the site-lock triggers
 * allowedURLs now works with URLs that don't start with "http://"
* Fixed camera shifting after resizing with StageSizeScaleMode
* Added flixel.util.FlxSignal and FlxG.signals

* FlxTween
 * backward is now a public, read-only property
 * renamed delay to startDelay
 * added loopDelay that controls the delay between loop executions with LOOPING and PINGPONG
 * Added easier to use FlxTween.tween() function, which automatically determines whether to use single VarTween or MultivarTween based on the number of Values being tweened
* Added some basic unit tests
* FlxCamera: removed followAdjust(), the followLead point should be set directly
* FlxSpriteUtil.screenWrap(): prevent sprite from ever being offscreen
* FlxSprite:
 * fixed crash on cpp with loadRotatedGraphic() on state switches

* FlxTypedButton
 * added allowSwiping flag
 * added allowHighlightOnMobile flag

3.1.0
------------------------------
* Refactor of FlxRandom
  * All functions are now deterministic and safe to use with replays
  * Due to the use of a new algorithm for pseudo-random number generation (a linear congruential generator) and a new seed type (integer instead of float values), old replays will have unpredictable results
  * FlxColorUtil.getRandomColor(), FlxArrayUtil.shuffle(), and FlxArrayUtil.getRandom() have been moved to FlxRandom.color(), FlxRandom.shuffleArray(), and FlxRandom.getObject(), respectively. The old functions are still in place but are marked as deprecated.
  * weightedPick(), weightedGetObject() and colorExt() have been added
  * Replays are now fully deterministic, whether replaying the whole game or just a single state.
* New FLX_NO_SOUND_SYSTEM conditional
* FlxTrailArea: 
 * can now be resized with setSize()
 * default delay is now 2
 * removed smoothing, use antialising instead

  * now the functions return the sprite / object to allow chaining
  * BUG: fixed null error in alphaMaskFlxSprite()
* FlxTypedButton refactor
  *  Callbacks are now set via the FlxButtonEvent objects, for example button.onDown.callback = someFunction;
  *  The type of callback has been changed from Dynamic to Void->Void to avoid Reflection. This means you need to bind custom parameters to your callback function like so: callback = someFunction.bind(1); ([more info](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/issues/805?source=cc))
  *  new labelAlphas and labelOffsets arrays for more control
  *  the highlight frame is now disabled by default on mobile

------------------------------
* Updated rendering system for cpp target so it uses 2d tile transformations now (which means non-uniform scaling is working now)
* FlxBitmapTextField's background property is working on cpp target now
* Replaced FlxDictionary with ObjectHash (for FlxControlHandler plugin)
* Added BTNTileMap class (which can be found in org.flixel.addons package) from http://bullettimeninja.blogspot.com/2012/01/lasers-and-ray-casting.html
* Added ZoomCamera class (also in org.flixel.addons package) from http://bullettimeninja.blogspot.com/2011/09/zoom-camera.html
* Made a little optimization for FlxSprite's onScreen() method for cpp target (not using Math.sqrt() now)
* Added width and height getters/setters for FlxCamera on flash target
* Made small optimizations in rendering for cpp target (the way it pushes and splices draw data)
* Fixed pixelPerfectPointCheck() method from FlxCollision plugin
* Made pixelPerfectCheck() method from FlxCollision plugin work on flash only. It's always returns false on other targets. Sorry:(
* Fixed FlxCamera's bug with changing it's size (width, height and zoom)

1.02
------------------------------
* Ported FlxBar class
* Added FlxBitmapTextField class (background property isn't working on cpp for now)
* Added PxButton class which uses FlxBitmapTextField for text rendering
* Replaced Dynamic with appropriate types (where it was possible)
* Improvements in FlxQuadTree and FlxObject (less garbage)
* Changed TileSheet creation process to insert gaps between frames. This should solve 'pixel bleeding' problem

1.01
------------------------------
* Finally ported FlxPreloader class
* Fixed issue with FlxTextField class when it wasn't affected by fade() and flash() effects (on cpp and neko targets)
* Improvements in memory consumption for FlxTileBlock and FlxBitmapFont classes
* Updated lib to work with haxe 2.09
* Ported FlxGridOverlay from Flixel-Power-Tools

1.00
------------------------------
