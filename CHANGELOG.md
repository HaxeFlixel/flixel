v.3.1.0
------------------------------
* Refactor of FlxRandom
  * All functions are now deterministic and safe to use with replays
  * Due to the use of a new algorithm for pseudo-random number generation (a linear congruential generator) and a new seed type (integer instead of float values), old replays will have unpredictable results
  * FlxColorUtil.getRandomColor(), FlxArrayUtil.shuffle(), and FlxArrayUtil.getRandom() have been moved to FlxRandom.color(), FlxRandom.shuffleArray(), and FlxRandom.getObject(), respectively. The old functions are still in place but are marked as deprecated.
  * weightedPick(), weightedGetObject() and colorExt() have been added
  * Replays are now fully deterministic, whether replaying the whole game or just a single state.
* New FLX_NO_SOUND_SYSTEM conditional

 * can now be resized with setSize()
 * default delay is now 2
 * removed smoothing, use antialising instead
 * is now compatible with animated sprites / sprites that have a spritesheet

  * allow FlxObjects in screenWrap() and screenCenter()
  * now the functions return the sprite / object to allow chaining
* FlxTypedButton refactor
  *  Callbacks are now set via the FlxButtonEvent objects, for example button.onDown.callback = someFunction;
  *  The type of callback has been changed from Dynamic to Void->Void to avoid Reflection. This means you need to bind custom parameters to your callback function like so: callback = someFunction.bind(1); ([more info](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/issues/805?source=cc))
  *  new labelAlphas and labelOffsets arrays for more control
  *  the highlight frame is now disabled by default on mobile
